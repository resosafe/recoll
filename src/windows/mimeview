# Pseudo entry used if the 'use desktop' preference is set in the GUI
# Could not get the cmd-based ones to work (tried quoting "start %u" too)
#application/x-all = c:/Windows/System32/cmd /c start %u
#application/x-all = cmd /c start %u
application/x-all = rclstartw %u

####### Special ones
# Open the parent epub document for epub parts instead of opening them as
# html documents. This is almost always what we want.
text/html|epub = rclstartw %F;ignoreipath=1
# Parent open for fs file.
application/x-fsdirectory|parentopen = rclstartw %f
inode/directory|parentopen = rclstartw %f

# PDF examples. These can be set from the GUI preferences "editor applications" section. Select
# application/pdf, check "exception to desktop preferences, and enter something similar to the below
# values.
#
#  Evince: this is usually installed with a version-specific path and in the user directory, so the
#  exact command value will need some tweaking (user name and version number). 
application/pdf = C:/users/bill/appdata/local/apps/evince-2.32.0.145/bin/evince --page-index=%p --find=%s %f
#  SumatraPDF: no search string
#application/pdf  = "C:/Program Files/SumatraPDF/SumatraPDF.exe" -page %p %f
#  Foxit: no search string 
#application/pdf = "C:/Program Files (x86)/Foxit Software/Foxit Reader/FoxitReader.exe" %f /A page=%p
#  PDFXEdit: supports a search string, but beware, the following only works after version 1.32.1,
#   previous ones can't process the semi-colon in the options
#application/pdf = "C:/Program Files/Tracker Software/PDF Editor/PDFXEdit.exe" /A "page=%p;search=%s" "%f"


##########
# Other MIME types have no specializations on Windows, but the types need to be listed for an "Open"
# link to appear in the result list, the listing is in the generic file
