  <h2>Recoll KDE KIO slave</h2>

  <p>Use this module to perform Recoll searches from any program with a KIO interface.</p>

  <p>The module used to work in two modes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>File manager interface</b>, <em>Only with KDE 4.1 and
        newer</em>, which presents results as directory entries</li>
    <li><b>HTML interface</b>, close to a simplified QT Recoll interface.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The HTML interface has been broken for some time (2022), and only the file manager interface
    currently works (in, e.g., Dolphin or Konqueror).</p>
  
  <p>You will undoubtedly obtain strange effects from time to time. If
    you have any remarks or ideas about improving kio_recoll, or observe an interesting and
    reproducible sequence, please <a href="mailto:jfd@recoll.org"> report it</a>.</p>


  <h3>File manager interface</h3>

  <p>The <i>path</i> part of an URI with a <i>recoll:</i> scheme
    (e.g. <i>recoll:&nbsp;some&nbsp;query</i>) is taken as a
    <a href="https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/usermanual/webhelp/docs/RCL.SEARCH.LANG.html">
      Recoll query language</a> string and
    executed. The results are displayed as directory entries.</p>
  
  <p>No search result details (samples, relevance etc.) are available, but this interface allows
    multiple selections and copies, usage inside any KDE open dialog, etc.</p>

  <p>To avoid swamping the interface with too many results, the result count is limited to 10000 by
    default. You can change this value by setting the <code>kio_max_direntries</code> parameter in
    your recoll configuration file (typically ~/.recoll/recoll.conf)</p>

  <h3>(Obsolete) HTML interface</h3>

  <p>This used to work in Konqueror, but appears to be broken in recent Konqueror versions. Doc
    kept for nostalgy.</p>
  
  <p>This works more or less like the Recoll QT GUI, much simplified. The 
    <a href="https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/usermanual/usermanual.html#RCL.SEARCH.LANG">
      Recoll manual</a> describes the queries that can be performed.</p> 

  <p>Most pages in the interface should quite self-explanatory.</p>

  <p>You normally enter this interface by entering "recoll:" or
    "recoll:/" in the Konqueror URL entry, and following the "search"
    link. You can also directly enter "recoll:/search.html".<br>  

    In most circumstances, entering a link like
    <a href="recoll:/john smith">recoll:/john smith</a> will also
    yield an HTML result list.</p>

  <p>Compared to QT Recoll, the nice point is that you can click or
    drag/drop the icons to access the results in the standard desktop
    way.</p>
