= Building Recoll with macports

== Install macports

https://www.macports.org/install.php

== Have a look at the doc about external/local packages

== Build Recoll

- Create a directory for the local ports repository and the recoll
  data. This could be anywhere but you do need the macports/textproc/recoll
  directories in the path. E.g.:

    mkdir -p ~/macports/textproc/recoll
  
- Edit /opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf, and insert an URL pointing to
  your local repository *before* the rsync one The file should look like
  the following (replace <me> with your user name):

    file:///Users/<me>/macports/
    rsync://rsync.macports.org/release/ports [default]

- Copy the Portfile file and the files/ subdirectory from the recoll source
  (in packaging/macports) to macports/textproc/recoll. The easiest way to
  do this is to retrieve the zipped Portfiles+files:
  https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/recoll/files/macports-recoll-1.26.3-portfile.zip
  Then extract it to /Users/<me>/textproc/recoll, which should then look
  like the following:
  
    /Users/<me>/macports/textproc/recoll/Portfile
    /Users/<me>/macports/textproc/recoll/files/...

- Run the MacPorts portindex command in the local repository's directory to
  create or update the local port index:

    cd /Users/<me>/macports
    portindex

Once the local port is added to the PortIndex, it becomes available for
searching or installation as with any other Portfile in the MacPorts tree,
for example run the following to build and install recoll:

    sudo port build recoll
    sudo port install recoll
